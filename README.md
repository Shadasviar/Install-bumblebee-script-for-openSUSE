# Install bumblebee script for openSUSE
Install bumblebee script for openSUSE, excluding 42.1, made by instructions from official forums:
> https://ru.opensuse.org/SDB:Bumblebee.

Tested on openSUSE 13.2 and Tumbleweed

# Instructions
If you have installed NVIDIA drivers and NVIDIA repositories or some other version of bumblebee, delete it by youself, because we can't forecast all cases of this stuff in the script.
If previous version of bumblebee was installed by this script, it would be enough only run it, script cleans software and repositories, installed by itself.

#P.S.
I will be pleased, if you propose changes for supporting more distributions :)
